    \item[Decidable] languages are languages for which there is at least one Turing machine that halts in a finite number of state table lookups for each input.
    \item[P] is the set of languages that are decidable in polynomial time using a deterministic Turing machine.
    \item[Polynomial] means that for a length of input $n$ the number of steps (state table lookups) is $O(n^k)$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$.
    \item[$\text{TIME}(n^k)$] is the set of languages decidable in $O(n^k)$ steps.
